# EE 110 Project
A project I am working on in another class is learning how to use Quartus and how that can be applied to engineering. 
In order to complete this project, I needed to become familiar with the system itself and practice building various circuits.
By doing this, I was able to apply the knowledge I gained in the lectures to the assignments themselves.

# Hypothetical Module, using Quartus to assist in finishing Skynet:
Using Quartus, though I don't know what it is, sounds like it could be of use in finishing the Skynet Project.
